overview: The Statamic Control Panel enables you to publish content, manage users, configure settings, run updates, and all manner of other useful things. It's responsive, intuitive, and powerful.

## Logging In {#logging-in}

You can access the Statamic Control Panel by visiting `yourwebsite.com/cp`. If you'd like to use a different URL, you can change the `$control_panel` variable in your `index.php` file accordingly.

```language-php
$control_panel = 'chamber-of-secrets';
```

## Disabling {#disabling}

You may disable the Control Panel by editing the value in your `index.php` file.

```language-php
$control_panel = false; // disabled
```

If you want to disable per-environment, you may add the following to your `.env` file on the appropriate environments.

```
DISABLE_CP=true
```

## Translating {#translating}

The Statamic Control panel may be translated into different languages.

The translation files for English are included, and are located in `statamic/resources/lang/en`. If you would like to translate another language, copy the `en` folder into `site/lang` and rename it to the short locale code of your choice, and begin editing the data inside.

By default, the Statamic Control Panel will be displayed in your default locale's language.

The default locale is the first one listed in your `locales` list in your System settings, which should also match the `$locale` setting in your `index.php` file.

```language-yaml
# system.yaml
locales:
  en:
    name: English
    full: en_US
    url: /
```

```language-php
// index.php
$locale = 'en';
```

The language is determined by taking the first portion of the `full` value.  
For example, `full: en_US` will use `en`.

You may override the Control Panel's locale by setting the `locale` value in:

- `site/settings/cp.yaml` to apply to all users.
- A user's file to apply to only that user.

This should be the short locale value (eg. `en`) rather than the full (eg. `en_US`)

For example, to display the Control Panel in French you would add the following:

``` .language-yaml
locale: fr
```

## Customizing the Stylesheet {#customizing-the-stylesheet}

Statamic will automatically load `site/helpers/cp/override.css` if it exists. You may drop any styles you wish into that file.

## Adding custom JavaScript {#adding-custom-javascript}

Statamic will automatically load `site/helpers/cp/scripts.js` if it exists. This could be a good place to add things like custom field conditions.
